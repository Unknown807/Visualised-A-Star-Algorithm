## Description

An animated run through of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* algorithm</a> in finding the shortest path with obstacles. Thanks to Sebastian Lague for the very clean <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L-WgKMFuhE">video</a> on A*.

The settings provided are buttons for clearing the canvas and running the algorithm, a status bar, sliders for the grid size and delay (in ms) for the searching animation and the tools (pen, eraser, start, goal) that let you draw on the canvas.
